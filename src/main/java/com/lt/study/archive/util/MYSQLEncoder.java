 * To Encoder special character.
 * If you want to insert binary data into a string column (such as a BLOB column), the following characters must be represented by escape sequences.
 NUL NUL byte (0x00). Represent this character by “\0” (a backslash followed by an ASCII “0” character).
 \ Backslash (ASCII 92). Represent this character by “\\”.
 ' Single quote (ASCII 39). Represent this character by “\'”.
 " Double quote (ASCII 34). Represent this character by “\"”.
 * Within a string, certain sequences have special meaning unless the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode is enabled. Each of these sequences begins with
 a backslash (“\”), known as the escape character. MySQL recognizes the following escape sequences in referencesMap
